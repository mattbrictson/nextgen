# Normally this file would be a binstub generated by bundler, but this would break nextgen's tests.
# When testing generators, we expect the generator code to execute within a clean bundler environment.
# Unfortunately, bundler's generated binstubs pollute ENV in a way that breaks this requirement.
# So rather than using the normal binstub, we just call `bundle exec` directly.
